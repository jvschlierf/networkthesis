Some of these variants, he warns, “may already be in existence” among the public but have not yet been detected — or may soon form as the pandemic continues. “And those variants, I think, we can expect to sweep up to much higher frequency once vaccination provides this huge selective force.”\n",

      "All we have from the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are these kinds of in vitro and in lab studies that if you expose them to these variants, this is what they'll do, but do we need some type of clinical efficacy? Would you say at this point that we don't have evidence of clinical efficacy against the variants with these two vaccines that are currently being distributed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly. The mRNA vaccines are not being tested extensively in areas where the variants are prospering, but one of the trial sites for Johnson &amp; Johnson was in South Africa. So they were able to see how their vaccines stood up against that variant and it fared very well in terms of prevention of serious disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "When do you think that we are going to get these types of studies? Is that something that we're going to see as the vaccine trials kind of evolve, and are we going to be able to get that from the mRNA vaccines? Are we just going to not know what their clinical efficacy is until we get a booster, we're just going to only have the lab evidence?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's likely that the virus is probably replicating at higher levels or more virus is replicating in terms of country here in the United States than almost anywhere else in the world, in terms of the breadth of cases that we've had, etc. We just simply do not have the genomic surveillance types of apparatus to necessarily detect these variants. For example, we're just now detecting the California variants. There may be many variants in the United States. We do know that the Brazilian, as well as the South African, variants are in the United States, and it's possible that there is community spread of these variants. So, we just have to really ramp up our sequencing efforts to really track what's happening within our pandemic within the country and what types of viruses that we're dealing with.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's in that kind of setting as variants begin to hold sway. For example, it's suggested that the U.K. variant will become dominant in the United States by March. So, our prediction is that the current vaccines will do very well against that variant. Now, if that variant is replaced by, for example, a South African variant, which is more immunologically daunting, well then we're going to have to see how the mRNA vaccines hold up against that. And it's that kind of real-world information that's going to inform whether or not we need to boost the immune system with a third shot.\n",

      "Now, another question is, is the virus throwing everything at us right now that it's got? Is this it and can we expect a pretty much static situation from here on out? And, you know, I don't think so. I think the virus still has tricks up its sleeve, and will continue to evolve as we put additional immune pressures on it. So, that would be my guess, but we're right at the cusp of the evolving science. And to think that where we were a year ago with no defense, no innate or no intrinsic immunity to this virus, and nothing really therapeutic or preventive. And now we're in a situation where we have multiple, highly effective vaccines. It's a true triumph of science.\n",

      "Can you go into how else the virus could mutate? Is there any way that it could mutate that T-cell immunity that we have that would be compromised? Is that possible or is it just not that complex a virus?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, there may be the emergence of escape mutations that escape a cytotoxic T-cell, CD8 T-cell responses, or CD4 helper T-cell responses. We could certainly see that and it's much harder to monitor for those types of immune reactions. So, certainly, like you get immune escape against antibodies, you can have immune escape against T-cell immunity as well.\n",

      "The variant \"is not resistant to vaccination,\"according to Benoît Elleboode, the director of the Regional Health Agency of New Aquitaine. After the discovery of a cluster of positive people with a \"very rare\" variant of Sars-CoV-2 identified in Bordeaux (Gironde), the health authorities are preparing to open the vaccination to all the major inhabitants of the Bacalan district and the surrounding areas. Franceinfo takes stock of the situation.\n",

      "&gt;&gt; Covid-19: follow the latest news in our live\n",
      "\n",
      "Family reunions at the origin of the cluster\n",
      "So far, at least 46 people have been identified as positive to a variant monitored by health authorities. The cluster, spotted on Thursday, was quickly taken over by the authorities. The number of people infected could increase as a major mass screening campaign has been launched in the Bacalan district in northern Bordeaux. The results on Friday, the first day of mass screening, are not yet known.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research carried out by Medicare has identified \"two chains of transmissions linked together,\"Patrick Dehail, medical advisor to the director of the ARS, told France 3 Nouvelle-Aquitaine. The contaminations reportedly occurred during family reunions on May 8, reports France Bleu. The virus then spread to Charles Martin School, where ten children tested positive. As a precaution, the facility was temporarily closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A derivative of the B.1.1.7 variant identified in the United Kingdom\n",
      "The variant that causes these contaminations is called \"VOC 20I/484Q\". VOC for \"Variant of concern\" in English, i.e. \"variable concern\". Although it is very rare, it is monitored because it is a derivative of the B.1.1.7 variant identified in the United Kingdom and has an additional mutation (E484Q) suspected of making it more transmissible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This variant has been identified by sequencing at the University Hospital of Bordeaux, and this is confirmed to the CNR in Lyon,\" Professor Patrick Dehail told France 3 Nouvelle-Aquitaine. The Lyon centre must now carry out \"a more detailed analysis of the entire genome\" of this variant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a variant already identified at the national level but very rare so far,\"says Patrick Dehail. It \"had only been detected in rare sporadic cases in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Grand-Est and Ile-de-France. However, clusters have recently been identified in Ile-de-France and New Aquitaine,\"Public Health France said in its latest update on emerging variants. \"On the face of it, there had never been a cluster like this in the general population,\"notes Patrick Dehail.\n",
      "\n",
      "A variant apparently no more dangerous\n",
      "Data on the transmission or dangerousness of this variant are still lacking. But the health authorities are reassuring. People infected \"are rather young people who do not make serious forms, who are not hospitalized,\"Benoît Elleboode, the director of the Regional Health Agency of New Aquitaine, told franceinfo. \"It's pretty reassuring. This gives evidence that this variant is not resistant to vaccination, since older people, who are vaccinated more than 80% for the over 65s and more than 50% for the over-50s, seem not to have been infected with this virus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An upcoming vaccination of all the major inhabitants of the district\n",
      "To stem the spread of this virus, health authorities have taken measures, with an important screening system and the search for all possible contact cases. At the same time, the Regional Health Agency is preparing an express vaccination campaign with the Ministry of Health in the area concerned. It is expected to start on Tuesday or Wednesday, according to France 3. In all, \"15,000 additional doses of vaccine will arrive within three weeks, with 5,000 doses as early as next week,\"Benoît Elleboode told franceinfo on Saturday.\n",

      "\n",
      "&gt;It adds: \"Because of the number of spike gene mutations also found in variants of interest or concern or under investigation (VOC or VUI), we recommended that this lineage is monitored closely for possible increased community transmission and functional studies undertaken to understand the impact on antibody recognition.\"\n",
      "COMMENT:\n",
      "&gt;However rare, these cases are important to investigate, experts say. “We want to make sure we’re not missing them. We also want to know where they’re happening, so there’s a geographic surveillance element. We want to look to see if there’s a pattern going on or if it’s a one-off,” said Dr. Mary Marovich, director of the vaccine research program at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ AIDS division. **If a cluster of cases all came from the same geographic area, that could indicate a variant on the rise, or perhaps a problematic batch of vaccines.**\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;While the vaccines so far have shown effectiveness against all known variants, Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of Pfizer’s vaccine clinical research and development, says scientists have to stay proactive in case new variants render the vaccines less effective: “I’m not a Pollyanna — there is potential for escape to occur,” he said, referring to the concept of the virus “escaping” the protection provided by a vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Some states have only gathered patchy information on the severity of their breakthrough cases. **If all breakthrough infections were mild or asymptomatic, that would indicate that the vaccines are consistently preventing people from needing hospitalization — which is what scientists expect and hope the shots will do. Without knowing when people get sick enough to be hospitalized, public health officials can’t dig deeper to find out why the vaccines didn’t do what they were supposed to.**\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;**“The sentinel event that we have to be on the lookout for is when these breakthrough infections result in severe COVID-19, like a hospitalization or death, because that’s what a vaccine is supposed to protect against,”** said Denis Nash, professor of epidemiology at the City University of New York’s Graduate School of Public Health &amp; Health Policy. In Michigan, where 246 cases of breakthrough infection have been identified as of March 31, records for about half of those cases did not have any information about whether or not the patient was hospitalized, health department spokesperson Lynn Sutfin told the Detroit News. New Jersey’s health department said it is tracking breakthrough infections but couldn’t say how many have occurred so far or whether anyone has been hospitalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;In many cases, sequencing to identify variants is not being done for a number of logistical reasons. Getting samples to sequence is difficult, said New Jersey health department spokesperson Donna Leusner. “Commercial labs do most of the PCR testing and commercial labs typically only keep samples for a couple of days before discarding. Thus by the time we are aware of the positive case, the sample was likely already discarded.” She added that the health department can’t say right now if breakthrough cases are more likely to be caused by variants because they don’t have a big enough data set.\n",

Similar mutations were also found in the New York and California variants.\n",

      "Although such changes might seem random, Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at Rockefeller University in New York City, suggests there are bigger forces at work. “It’s clear there’s convergent evolution going on,” says Bieniasz, referring to an evolutionary principle in which organisms independently evolve similar traits due to similar environments or pressures.\n",

      "&gt;In early January, The National Institue of Infectious Diseases in Japan detected a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 in travelers arriving from Brazil a few days earlier. The new variant carried identical mutations to the spike protein as P.1, aside from one additional point mutation—V1176F. Notably, B.1.1.248 carries the N501Y mutation, which is documented to increase the virus’s transmissibility, and E484K, which increases the virus’s resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Mutations to other proteins were not included in the published literature.\n",

      "&gt;P.1 is a particularly nasty variant of SARS-CoV-2. It has reinfected people in Manaus, making them sick once again after infection earlier in the pandemic. It is also highly transmissible and reportedly resistant to antibodies from both vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;The unique point mutation V1176F is located in the second heptad repeat of the virus. The heptad repeats form a helix structure centrally-located on the virus. These helical bundles are essential for the viral fusion of the virus to the human cell. A mutation to this region may increase the transmissibility of the virus by optimizing viral fusion, but further investigation is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.\n",
